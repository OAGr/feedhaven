{"name":"Feedhaven","tagline":"A feed management system","body":"# Feedhaven.  Liberate your data.\r\nMost online data is behind the walls of big applications that don't play\r\nwell with others.  Use Feedhaven to take your data and store it in a way\r\nthat's completely accessible to you.  \r\n   \r\n![revolution](doc/images/haven6.jpg)\r\n## What is Feedhaven?\r\n\r\nFeedhaven is a platform for storing and editing data in a generalized feed format.  Feedhaven is meant to be used in combination with other tools to import and export data from other applicaitons.  We suggest that you use Feedhaven to store most data that you care about on the internet, in order to keep forever and use easily for any purpose you choose.  \r\n\r\n### Screenshot (Feed page)  \r\n![screenshot](doc/images/screenshot-feed.png)\r\n  \r\nFeedhaven is currently in development mode and has not yet reached\r\nalpha.  We encourage you to take a look, but keep in mind that the\r\ncodebase is lacking in tests and polish.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recommended feeds to import to Feedhaven\r\n* Emails\r\n* RSS Feeds\r\n* Social Feeds (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)\r\n* Rescuetime data\r\n* SMSs\r\n* Chat messanges\r\n\r\n### Apps that can import data to Feedhaven\r\nFeedhaven has a very simple REST JSON API.  In order to import data to\r\nFeedhaven, first create a feed on Feedhaven, then post entries to that\r\nfeed in the proper format.  Two existing applications that can do that are:\r\n* [Huginn](https://github.com/cantino/huginn)\r\n* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)  \r\n  \r\nWe encourage you to either extend Huginn or write other apps to pull\r\nmore data to Feedhaven.\r\n\r\n### Feedhaven feeds export directly to\r\n* ATOM\r\n* JSON\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nFeedhaven was made to work easily with Heroku.  It does requre a MongoDB\r\ndatabase.  We recommend MongoHQ or Mongolab to assist with providing a\r\nhosted MongoDB database.  Both provide free storage for up to 500MB of\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n### MongoDB with MongoHQ\r\nIf you sign up for MongoHQ with heroku, linking them is easy.  Just set the relevent ENV to\r\nthe uri mongodb://{username}:{password}@linus.mongohq.com:{port}/app{app\r\nID}\r\n\r\n### Hosted Version\r\nWe are working to provide a paid hosted version directly through\r\nFeedHaven shortly.\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\nFeedhaven is still in early development.  We expect to reach alpha in the next\r\nfew weeks.  So far the code is functional for importing, holding, and\r\naccessing data.  However, there are still no tests, no user\r\nadministration, and no data security layers.  Consider the project very\r\nearly stage.\r\n\r\n## Feedhaven data structure\r\nThe main structure of Feedhaven encompasses feeds and entries.  One feed has many entries, and each entry belongs to one feed.  All data is stored on MongoDB.\r\n\r\n### Feed\r\n  { id (generated) : The unique identifier for the object  \r\n    Title (required) : The title of the feed  \r\n    Subtitle : Extra information about the feed  \r\n    Source : A link of the website where the content is pulled from. In the case where this is ambiguous, please provide a description  \r\n    Rights : The rights pertaining the public permission to use contents of this feed \r\n    Tags : Tags for the feed  \r\n    Categories : Categories hash  \r\n    Icon : A URL to a picture used to describe this feed. The picture should be at least 100x100px, preferable square  \r\n    Updated (not editable) : Most recent time when a feed collection / entry was edited, added, or deleted  \r\n    Updated_at (Not editable) : Most recent time when the feed element itself was edited or created  \r\n    Created_at (Not Editable) : The time when the feed element was created  \r\n    Dump : A hash for any additional key values  \r\n    author :  \r\n              { name : Author Name  \r\n                email : Author Email  \r\n                uri : Author Uri  \r\n                }  \r\n  }\r\n\r\n### Entry\r\n  { id (generated) : The unique identifier for the object  \r\n    Title (required) : The title of the feed  \r\n    Summary : Extra information about the feed  \r\n    Link : A revelant link or link to the original content  \r\n    Published : The time the entry was published  \r\n    Updated : The time the entry was most recently edited  \r\n    Dump : A hash with any additional key values  \r\n    author :  \r\n              { name : Author Name (if different from feed)   \r\n                email : Author Email (if different from feed)  \r\n                uri : Author Uri (if different from feed)  \r\n                }  \r\n  }\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n| Path                     | Method   | Description                    |\r\n| ------------------------ | :------: | ------------------------------ |\r\n| /feeds                   | GET      | List all feeds                 |\r\n| /feeds                   | POST     | Create a new feed              |\r\n| /feeds/:id               | GET      | Retrieve info on a feed object |\r\n| /feeds/:id               | PUT      | Replaces a feed object         |\r\n| /feeds/:id               | DELETE   | Removes a feed object          |\r\n| /feeds/:id/entries       | GET      | List all entries for a feed    |\r\n| /feeds/:id/entries       | POST     | Create a new entry for a feed  |\r\n| /verify/:id/entries/:id  | GET      | Retrieve info on an entry      |\r\n| /verify/:id/entries/:id  | PUT      | Replaces a entry object        |\r\n| /verify/:id/entries/:id  | DELETE   | Removes entry object           |\r\n \r\n\r\n## License\r\nFeedhaven is provided under the MIT License.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OAGr/feedhaven.png)](https://travis-ci.org/OAGr/feedhaven)\r\n\r\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/OAGr/feedhaven.png)](https://gemnasium.com/OAGr/feedhaven)\r\n\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/OAGr/feedhaven.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/OAGr/feedhaven)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
