<p style="text-align:center"> Our goal at Feedhaven is to promote a collaborative and free internet.  To accomplish this, we've build Feedhaven both to open other applications and to itself be standardized and open.  We hope that the greater internet community helps to tie the web together.  Our team is currently two people and we cannot do this alone.  </p>

    <h3> Write Wrapers to Import Data</h3>

    <h3>Support Internet Openness </h3>
    <p>Encourage coorporations and organizations to release their data and help incoorporate open standards.  Once there, they can be easily accessed by Feedhaven and other Applictions. </p>

    <h3>Improve our Open Feed Format</h3>
    <p>Currently Feedhaven stores all data as JSON using the standard ATOM keys with some extra information specific to social applications.  We want your opinions to help improve or replace this with a standard universal feed format.</p>
